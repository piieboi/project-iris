# Terms of Service for Project IRIS

## 1. No Child Endangerment Content

Any content involving child endangerment will be reported to the authorities immediately. This is non-negotiable and strictly enforced.

## 2. No Sensitive or Personal Information

Do not share sensitive or personal information. We do not need or want this information. Protect your privacy.

## 3. No Reverse-Engineering

Do not attempt to reverse-engineer the AI. It is unnecessary and a violation of these terms.

## 4. Compliance with Discord's Terms of Service

For Discord Bots using the IRIS engine, all content generated must comply with Discordâ€™s Terms of Service.

## 5. No DDoS Attacks

Do not engage in DDoS attacks or any other form of malicious activity against IRIS bots. We are providing free software without selling your data; attacking us is unfair and counterproductive.

## Consequences of ToS Violations

### Regular Violations

Any violation of these Terms of Service will result in being blacklisted from using any Luaily LLC services. For appeals, contact: [webmaster+appeals@pieboi.xyz.](mailto:webmaster+appeals@pieboi.xyz.)

### Child Endangerment Violations

Any child endangerment content you produce (whether by making the chatbot produce it or by feeding it to the chatbot) will be reported to the authorities.

Reports can be made to: [webmaster+ce@pieboi.xyz](mailto:webmaster+ce@pieboi.xyz). These will be forwarded to tips.fbi.gov. The user responsible will be immediately blacklisted from all software provided by Luaily LLC.
